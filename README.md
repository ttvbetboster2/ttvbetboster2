- 🌱 I’m currently learning: web development (HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL), programming logic, and Fysikk 1 + Kjemi 1 📘⚗️  
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on: small student-level projects or challenges to build experience  
- 🧠 I’m looking for help with: improving backend coding skills and writing clean, efficient code  
- 💬 Ask me about: building login systems, cookies in PHP, and how to make simple websites
